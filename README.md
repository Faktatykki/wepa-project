WEPA-Project

Project is part of Helsinki University's department of computer science course TKT21007 "Web-palvelinohjelmointi" which introduces the basics of web development.
This project is pretty basic social media platform, so called "old school Facebook", where all the very basic functionalities of many social media platforms are featured.
Such as creating personal account, sending friend requests to other users, uploading photos, liking photos, publishing on other people's wall, commenting and so on.
Program is written in Java and HTML utilizing Spring Boot, ThymeLeaf and PostgreSQL.

UX is extremely primitive since utilizing only HTML.

Before starting the project I had next to none experience with web development related programming, hence learning curve can be seen in the project.

Yours truly,

Sampo
